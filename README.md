## About
Twintaillauncher is a multi-platform launcher that brings mod support, quality-of-life improvements, and advanced features to a variety of anime-styled games.<br>
TTL is an all-in-one tool for downloading, managing, and launching your favorite anime games. Itâ€™s designed with flexibility, ease of use, and customization in mind.
### Supported games
* Genshin Impact
* Honkai: Star Rail
* Honkai Impact 3rd
* Zenless Zone Zero
* Wuthering Waves
* Punishing: Gray Raven

### Is TTL safe to use? Can I get banned?
We do our best to ensure the launcher avoids detection and doesn't interfere with sensitive files or anti-cheat systems. However, some games require the Launcher to disable the anti-cheat to get them running (Linux only). So use TTL at your own risk.
